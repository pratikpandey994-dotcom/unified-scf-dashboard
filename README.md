# Unified SCF Portfolio Dashboard

This app consolidates Nikhil's CP account view and Pankit's direct-sales view into one Streamlit dashboard.

## Run

```powershell
cd C:\Users\PratikPandey\scf-dashboard
streamlit run app.py
```

The existing `dashboard.py` is left intact. The unified dashboard entry point is `app.py`.

## Files

- `app.py` - Streamlit UI, team/AM filters, tabs, charts, and tables.
- `data_loader.py` - single cached `load_data()` function for Excel ingestion.
- `metrics.py` - all portfolio segmentation, KPI, repayment, utilization, and opportunity logic.

## Default Data Paths

When manual upload is off, the app loads these local files from `C:\Users\PratikPandey\Downloads`:

- `scf_am_team___view_1_with_suspension_reasons_2026-06-05T13_49_41.37721429Z.xlsx`
- `view_2_2026-06-05T13_49_21.379501371Z.xlsx`
- `us_scf___master_data___handover_date_2026-06-05T14_10_07.092355226Z.xlsx`
- `Historic OB.xlsx`
- `us_scf___daily_ob_by_accounts_2026-06-03T15_05_48.33250036Z.xlsx`

Manual uploads are available from the sidebar.
For UI testing, switch the sidebar `Source` to `Dummy data`.

## Team Logic

- Nikhil CP Team: partner-backed CP accounts, excluding direct partner accounts, for Nikhil's AM list.
- Pankit Direct Team: non-partner/direct accounts for Pankit's AM list.
- Users first select the team, then select `All team AMs` or one AM.
- Account type and raw status filters are exposed as multiselects.

## Metric Rules

- Total facility = `Facility_Size + Overdraft_Limit`.
- Utilization = `OB / Total facility`.
- 75% target OB = `Total facility * 0.75`.
- Gap to 75% = `max(75% target OB - OB, 0)`.
- Repayments follow the Pankit-style account logic using invoice rows settled MTD:
  `max(Origination - Outstanding, 0)` for `closed`, `paid`, `received`, or `partial` stages.
- Net OB = `OB - MTD repayments`.
- Overdue OB = open invoice outstanding where `dpd > 7 and dpd <= 90`.
- NPA OB = open invoice outstanding where `dpd > 90`.
- WIRR = OB-weighted IRR.

## Validation Notes

The available Excel files contain the required Nikhil/SCF source columns. Pankit's original reference file contained precomputed React data, so the unified app derives Pankit's direct-team view from the same master, view 1, view 2, and OB files using the segmentation rules above.
Dummy mode generates deterministic synthetic CP and Direct portfolios for safe UI and metric testing.
